# Use this script to install packages via CRAN, for example: 

# NOTE: Code below shows how you install R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor. For CRAN packages, you can use 
# the standard install.packages() function; for Bioconductor packages, however, you 
# must first install BiocManager and then use that for installs. 

# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "arules"), 
#                  dependencies = TRUE, 
#                  repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com/')
